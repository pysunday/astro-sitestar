The main goal in creating this template was to recreate the look of the voidzero.dev website using only Uno CSS. Outside of a few exceptions, that goal was accomplished.</p><p><br/></p><p>The secondary goal of this template was to be something a developer could pick up and edit to fit their needs easily. It stays as close to Astro practices as possible, doesnât include unnecessary plugins or build processes. If you build sites with Astro and use any of the official templates as a base, this should be familiar to work in.</p>",
